# CuriousKoalas.com

This is the repository hosting the website for Curious Koalas, where we will be hosting educational projects that parents can do with their children to introduce them to the DIY/maker hobby.

Curious Koalas is a solo project run at my own expense and will never use advertising, any form of data collection, or any form of profiting off this project. The ultimate goal is for all the projects hosted here to be completely open source, and allow contributions from anyone interested in doing so.
