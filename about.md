# What is Curious Koalas?

Curious Koalas is my attempt at creating fully open source educational projects aimed at children (and ex-children) to help introduce more people to the DIY/maker hobby and related STEM skills. Spanning hardware and software, the idea is to release a series of follow-along guides teaching people how easy it is to make things yourself.

This is an entirely self-funded no-advertising privacy-friendly project. I have no intentions to ever profit off this, and all expenses come out of my own pocket. The ultimate idea is to eventually have contributions from the general public, and this website along with all material relating to every published project is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/curiouskoala), where anyone can contribute issues, corrections, ideas, etc.

I aim to have all projects doable by people with little-to-no experience, with tools you most likely have at home (or at most, can pick up cheaply). No special equipment or expensive workshop tools will be required.
